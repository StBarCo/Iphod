  <p> These devotions follow the basic structure of the Daily Office of the Church and are
      particularly appropriate for families with young children.
  <p>
  <p> The Reading and the Collect may be read by one person, and the other parts said in
      unison, or in some other convenient manner.
  </p>
  <p> Appropriate Opening Sentences, Psalms, Readings, and Collects are provided in each
      service. When desired, however, the Collect of the Day, or any of the Collects appointed in
      the Daily Offices, may be used instead. The Opening Sentences may be replaced by those
      appointed for various seasons in the liturgies for Morning and Evening Prayer.
  </p>    
  <p> The Psalms and Readings may be replaced by those appointed in</p>
  <ol class="fam_ol">
    <li>the Lectionary for Sundays, Holy Days, or the Common of Saints;</li>
    <li>the Daily Office Lectionary;</li>
    <li>some other manual of devotion which provides daily selections for the Church Year.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> A concluding Grace from Morning or Evening Prayer may be used at the end of any of
      these devotions.
