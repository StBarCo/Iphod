<p class= "default">Lord God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ triumphed over the
powers of death and prepared for us our place in the new Jerusalem:
Grant that we, who have this day given thanks for his resurrection,
may praise you in that City of which he is the light, and where he
lives and reigns forever and ever.
<span class= "italic"> Amen.</span></p>
