    confess and bless you, and men, women and children everywhere
    love you and serve you in peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
    Amen.",
    "Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this
    night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the
    sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the
    suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your loveâ€™s
    sake. Amen.",
    "O God, you manifest in your servants the signs of your presence:
    Send forth upon us the Spirit of love, that in companionship with
    one another your abounding grace may increase among us; through
    Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen."
