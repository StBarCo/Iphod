<p class= "default">O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and everlasting God, you have
brought us safely to the beginning of this day: Defend us by your
mighty power, that we may not fall into sin nor run into any danger;
and that guided by your Spirit, we may do what is righteous in your
sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <span class= "italic"> Amen.</span></p>
