  <p> For those saying Compline every day, particularly in families or other communities, additional
      short Scriptural readings may be desired. Some appropriate readings include:
  </p>
  <ul class="appro_readings">
    <li>Isaiah 26:3-4</li>
    <li>Isaiah 30:15a</li>
    <li>Matthew 6:31-34</li>
    <li>2 Corinthians 4:6</li>
    <li>1 Thessalonians 5:9-10</li>
    <li>1 Thessalonians 5:23</li>
    <li>Ephesians 4:26-27</li>
  </ul>
  <p> If desired, either version of the Lord’s Prayer may conclude with the phrase, “deliver us from evil,”
      omitting the doxology.
